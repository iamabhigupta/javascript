**Promises in JavaScript:**
Promises are a more structured way of handling asynchronous operations compared to callbacks. They were introduced to help manage complex asynchronous code, making it more readable and maintainable. Promises represent a value that might be available now, or in the future, or never.

**Simple Explanation:**
Think of a promise like a placeholder for a future value or result. Imagine ordering a package online. The promise is like the tracking number you receive. It tells you that your package will be delivered, and you can wait for it, but you don't need to keep checking the delivery status yourself.

**Use Cases:**
Promises are used in scenarios where you have asynchronous operations that should happen one after another or in parallel. Some common use cases include:

1. **API Calls**: Fetching data from a server and waiting for the response.
2. **Chaining Operations**: Performing a series of operations that depend on each other.
3. **Error Handling**: Handling both successful and failed outcomes in a structured way.

**Example Code:**
Here's an example of creating and using a promise to simulate fetching data from an API:

```javascript
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };
      resolve(data); // Data fetched successfully
    }, 2000);
  });
}

fetchData()
  .then((data) => {
    console.log('Data fetched:', data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  });
```

In this example, the `fetchData` function returns a promise that resolves with data after a 2-second delay. We use the `.then` method to handle the successful outcome and the `.catch` method to handle errors.

**Check for Understanding:**
Do you feel comfortable with the concept of promises in JavaScript and their usage for managing asynchronous operations?

If you're ready, I'd be happy to provide you with practice exercises related to promises. Just let me know when you're prepared!

Fantastic! Let's move forward with some practice exercises to reinforce your understanding of promises in JavaScript.

**Practice Exercises:**

**Exercise 1: Basic Promise**
Create a function called `wait` that returns a promise. This promise should resolve after a specified number of milliseconds with a message "Done waiting!".

**Exercise 2: Chaining Promises**
Write a function called `getRandomNumber` that returns a promise. This promise should resolve with a random number between 1 and 10. Use the value from the resolved promise to determine if the number is even or odd, and then log that information.

**Exercise 3: Error Handling**
Create a function called `divideNumbers` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns a promise. The promise should resolve with the result of dividing the first number by the second number. If the second number is 0, the promise should reject with an error message "Cannot divide by zero".
